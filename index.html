        Leonardo da Vinci (English: /ˌliːəˈnɑːrdoʊ də ˈvɪntʃi, ˌliːoʊˈ-, ˌleɪoʊˈ-/;[a] 14/15 April 1452[b] – 2 May
        1519)[4] was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who is widely considered one of the greatest painters
        of all time. The Mona Lisa is the most famous of his works and the most famous portrait ever made.[5] The Last
        Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time[6] and his Vitruvian Man drawing is also regarded
        as a cultural icon.[7] He is also known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on science and
        invention; these involve a variety of subjects including anatomy, cartography, painting, and palaeontology.
        Leonardo's collective works compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his
        contemporary Michelangelo.[8]</p>

    <p>Properly named Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci,[c] Leonardo was born out of wedlock to a notary, Piero da Vinci,
        and a peasant woman, Caterina, in Vinci, in the region of Florence, Italy. Leonardo was educated in the studio
        of the renowned Italian painter Andrea del Verrocchio. Much of his earlier working life was spent in the service
        of Ludovico il Moro in Milan, and he later worked in Rome, Bologna and Venice. He spent his last three years in
        France, where he died in 1519.</p>

    <p>Although he had no formal academic training,[9] many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime
        exemplar of the "Renaissance Man" or "Universal Genius", an individual of "unquenchable curiosity" and
        "feverishly inventive imagination."[6] He is widely considered one of the most diversely talented individuals
        ever to have lived.[10] According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were
        without precedent in recorded history, and "his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, while the man
        himself mysterious and remote."[6] Scholars interpret his view of the world as being based in logic, though the
        empirical methods he used were unorthodox for his time.[</p>
